  <h4>Biography</h4>
  <p>Gabrielle Douglas made history at London 2012, becoming the first black gymnast to win an Olympic title, blazing a trail for the likes of Simone Biles. Douglas also became the first American to win all-around and team golds at the same Games.

The signs that Douglas was different were present early. At three, she scaled doorframes around her house. Within a week of being shown a cartwheel by her elder sister, she was performing them one-armed, prompting her sibling to suggest she enrol in gymnastics.

By the time she was nine, 'Gabby' knew she wanted to compete in the Olympics. Five years later, she left her family in Virginia to train with renowned coach Liang Chow in Iowa. Her dedication paid off quickly with the 16-year-old helping the USA to team gold in her first senior season at the 2011 World Championships in Tokyo.</p>
